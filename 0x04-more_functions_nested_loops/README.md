Functions in C
In this section, we will revisit the basics of functions and build upon them:

Basic function syntax.
Declaring and defining a function.
Function prototypes.
Scope and lifetime of variables inside functions.
Recursion.
Nested Loops
Looping is a crucial aspect of any programming language. Here, we'll dive deep into:

Practical applications of nested loops.
Patterns and sequences using nested loops.
Common mistakes and how to avoid infinite loops.
Optimization techniques for nested loops.
More Advanced Topics
Venture into more advanced aspects of functions and nested loops:

Function pointers and their utility.
Recursive functions and real-world use cases.
Passing arrays to functions.
Working with multi-dimensional arrays.
Practical Assignments
Hands-on exercises to solidify your learning:

Create patterns like pyramids using nested loops.
Implement search algorithms via functions.
Small projects demonstrating the use of advanced functions and nested loops.
Challenges
Test your knowledge and debugging skills:

Debug exercises where you identify and fix issues in functions or loops.
Craft efficient code minimizing loop iterations.
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the C files using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output_filename.
Run the output file to see the results.
